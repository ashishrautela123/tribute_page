				Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an
				Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He
				was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent
				the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
				Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
				involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came
				to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
				vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
				India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

				Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
				Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
				President",he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single
				term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
				civilian honour.

				While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from
				an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
				attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state
				honours

				Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
				pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of
				Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother
				Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and
				forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.

				Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been
				wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar
				are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders
				and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island
				and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the
				opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family
				fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
				poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the
				family's meager income.
